The image 'op_amp134.png' primarily shows a circuit that is identified as an operational amplifier (op-amp). The key concepts and structure of this circuit are as follows, based on the text description in the associated document:

1. **Differential Input Stage**: The circuit includes a differential input stage formed by transistors M4 and M5. This stage is crucial for an operational amplifier as it receives inputs V⁻ and V⁺ respectively. The differential pair is essential for an op-amp, as it allows the amplifier to amplify the voltage difference between two inputs.

2. **Current Mirror Structure**: A current mirror structure is implemented using transistors M6 and M7. This structure serves as an active load for the differential pair. It converts differential currents into a single-ended voltage signal. This feature is significant in enabling high gain, which is an essential characteristic of the internal architecture of an op-amp.

These points highlight the fundamental components and functions of the operational amplifier circuit depicted in 'op_amp134.png'.
